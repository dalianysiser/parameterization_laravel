# Parameterization

This project provides a versatile and dynamic solution for managing data related to any type of information. While initially designed to handle personal information, its flexible architecture allows it to adapt to any type of data requiring dynamic forms, interactive combos, and advanced relationships between database tables.

## **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Form Management:** Forms are dynamically generated based on the information stored in the database, ensuring a fully parameterized experience.
- **Dynamic Combo Support:** Includes interactive combo options with associated data and automatically selects previously stored values.
- **Related Data Handling:** Integration between tables such as `person_type_information`, `detail_type_information`, and `type_combo_information` (adaptable for other domains of data).
- **Mass Deletion:** Efficiently delete multiple related records with ease.
- **Field Customization:** Supports various data types (`text`, `date`, `number`, `checkbox`, `select`).
- **Adaptability:** Designed to be reusable and configurable for specific needs, whether for people, products, processes, or any other domain.

## **Key Advantages**
This project is ideal for those who don't want to rely on static designs. The data is fully parameterized, and dynamic forms are created in correspondence with the stored information, automatically adapting to changes in data. This makes it highly flexible for handling different types of information and customizable to diverse needs.

## **Project Structure**
- **Controllers:** Handle the logic for dynamic forms and related data.
- **Models:** Represent the main database tables, including relationships such as PersonTypeInformation, DetailTypeInformation, etc. (models are adjustable for other domains).
- **Views:** Interface for managing data and generating dynamic forms.
- **Frontend Scripts:** Use JavaScript to integrate dynamic functionalities such as onChange events and combo option generation.

## **Adaptability**
This project is not limited to managing personal information. Its modular design allows it to easily adapt to other scenarios, such as:
- Product management.
- Process tracking.
- System configuration.
- Any other needs involving dynamic forms and related data.

---

## **Fully Parameterized Design**
The data is fully parameterized based on the information stored in the database, and dynamic forms are generated to correspond with the stored data. This approach is extremely useful for avoiding reliance on static designs and ensuring flexibility to adapt to any changes in data.
